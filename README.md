# NEXT LEVEL WEEK #4 - ReactJS Path  
____________________________________
This was my first participation in a NLW by RocketSeat. Until now it was really ejoyfull. That was the first time that I enjoyed that much while learning. My knowledge went higher than i thought it will. MoveIt is an application that helps us to stay health while working and learning, because we all know how unhealthy is to stay on PC 24/7. I choose the ReactJS path, and basically everything I saw on that path was new to me: react, next and typeScript.
